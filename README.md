# podosome_dynamics
MATLAB is required to run the code. Both scripts execute directly. life_cycle.m plots the quantitative time course of key variables over the oscillatory cycle, while phase_diagram.m generates a three-dimensional phase diagram that maps the rich dynamical landscape of podosome behavior across varying mechanical and biochemical conditions.
